# pgn2mp3

- To run use main.py
- I am unsure about my own parser, a better existing parser would be better
- It requires cloud text to speech from google, which requires an API key file on the keys folder
- An easy change can make it use a free text 2 speech without an api key

## TODO

- use move sequence as cache file name

## How to install and run tests:

```
pip --install requirements.txt
python3 -m unittest discover tests
```
